  <p>The Redchillies VFX used a one of its kind life sized 3D printed model (of SRK himself) to create a younger paradigm, SRK.</p>
    <p>He had to give Gaurav well toned and chubby cheeks. But after trying hard enough, one day Greg was wondering, while in his office, and discovered the mould of Brad Pitt.

He saw that he had an unusual cheek and jaw structure.

Therefore he endeavored to give Gaurav, Brad’s facial built which turned out to be successful. Therefore finally after 70 days of hard work he successfully achieved his goal.

But this was not only it. Greg and SRK along with the rest of the makeup crew had to patiently sit for 5 to 6 hours daily just in order to apply prosthetics and silicon on SRK’s face which would make him look younger.

They had to tape SRK eye lids and cheeks upside to give them shape.

They used plums to push SRK’s upper jaw up.

They used little eye brow pieces to make it look thicker. Then finally after immense hard work the look was successfully established.

Finally, after the completion of all the shorts the VFX artists initiated their work.

Firstly they all had to make Gaurav’s nose appear smaller than that of Aryan’s.

Then, they had to fill up the parts in between prosthetics and silicon. They also had to make the facial tone smoother and even.

Followed by this they had to enhance the gap between the nose and upper lip.

Then they had to make Gaurav’s eyes beseem bigger and move the jaw line slightly up.

Finally removal of the difference between prosthetics and the real skin was to take place.

Then the expressions were to be changed and the lips were to be adjusted accordingly.

After all the VFX used in face customization of his other physical features was started. For instance they had to remove Adams apple and muscles behind neck.

Then they had to shrink Gaurav’s build by narrowing and straightening his shoulders, and removing the muscles.

Due to the changes brought up in his body they had to perform several body scans.

To make correct and absolute measurements for Gaurav’s body scanning they were to be done while SRK was trying Gaurav’s costumes.</p>
